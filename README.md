# 🎓 Campus Event Q&A Assistant

## 📌 Overview
The Campus Event Q&A Assistant is an AI-powered application designed to help students quickly access accurate information about campus events such as workshops, seminars, cultural fests, orientations, and registrations. Instead of manually browsing notices or websites, students can ask natural language questions and receive instant, relevant answers.

This project demonstrates the practical use of AI-driven conversational systems to solve real-world information access problems commonly faced in educational institutions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In many campuses, event-related information is scattered across emails, notice boards, and multiple platforms. Students often miss important updates due to:
- Information overload  
- Lack of centralized access  
- Time-consuming manual searches  

This project addresses that gap by providing a single conversational interface for campus event queries.

## 💡 Solution
The Campus Event Q&A Assistant allows users to ask questions like:
- “What events are happening this week?”
- “Where is the AI workshop conducted?”
- “How do I register for the coding hackathon?”

The assistant processes the query, extracts intent and key details, and responds with clear and concise answers based on the available event data and prompt-driven logic.
